Project- Blackjack Game
In this project I will be creating a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.

Here are the requirements:

To create a simple text-based BlackJack game
The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
The player can stand or hit.
The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
Need to keep track of the player's total money.
Need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...
